Rinat: this is an artifact from "Scaling ML" line of development. Current status - private. Concrete steps:

0. Done: Sergey and Rinat draft the workspace bueprint. Run Trustbit Brownbag on Nix workspace to share the knowledge.
1. Done: Rinat writes preface that targets CEO/CTO audience and could be used to draft a blog post.
2. DSML team (Seb, Christoph, Vadim and JÃ¶rg) decides if it is OK to open source this specific project.
3. Marketing takes over the content and converts into a blog post (regardless of OSS decision, but affects the blog post).
4. Vadim: introduces workspace to Walter Group to users of workspace v1 (something they can use for free. Discuss the support implications with JÃ¶rg, Christoph and Seb first).
5. Sergey: mentions workspace at VEROO to users of workspace v1 (something they can use for free. Discuss the support implications with JÃ¶rg, Christoph and Seb first).

Data Science Platform Workspace
===============================

Current business landscape is changing rapidly. Software is driving that change across multiple directions: digitalization, sustainability, AI/ML. 

Have you heard about Generative AIs (ChatGPT, StableDiffusion, DALL-E)? Although, they are just a tip of the iceberg, they alone can be enough to influence [money allocation in the industry](https://a16z.com/2023/01/19/who-owns-the-generative-ai-platform/).

**Have you heard about the recent big tech lay-offs** by Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and many others? They are doing that to get lean and pivot towards the new market trends (arguably, [these layoffs are also not that large on the global scale](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-layoffs-are-not-as-big-as-they-appear-at-first-glance-11674251270)).


Large and small companies alike face the similar problem: **you need the right talent to address new challenges**, you need **more capacity to allocate**. Data Scientists, ML Engineers, MLOps, Product Leads with understanding of DS/ML.

There are two ways companies could handle this problem at the root:

1) Hire more people - attract the talent, while competing with every other company on the labour market.
2) Make existing people more happy and productive, while also improving retention.

Both of these are existential problems. They require strategy, organisational support and execution. 

This Github project is an example of a solution by Trustbit, part of a Data Science Platform. It demonstrates one tactical approach of dealing with a company-scale problem.
